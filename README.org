* Introduction
  A minor mode shows context in a child-frame. You need Emacs 29.1 to run it, as treesitter-context use the builtin treesit.

  Here context means which class/method/function you are looking at, which loops/conditions are surrounding the cursor, so you can have an overview of where you are.

  It depends on [[https://github.com/zbelial/posframe-plus][posframe-plus]], which depends on [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]] further.
  
* Languages supported
  - c
  - cpp
  - java
  - rust
  - python
  - go

* How to install and use
  Clone this repo, add the path to `load-path`, then enable `treesitter-context-mode` in a buffer or add it to the <lang>-ts-mode-hook, where <lang> is a language this package supports. Like
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp 
    (add-hook 'rust-ts-mode-hook #'treesitter-context-mode)
  #+END_SRC

  Be sure your Emacs version is 29.1 and above (built with tree-sitter support), and install the tree-sitter parsers you need.

* CAUTION
  - +For some languages, such as go and java, treesitter-context cannot capture the "else" branch of the "if statement", so if the cursor in an "else" block, treesitter-context will display the "if" branch information.+
    Fixed now.

* How to contribute
  If you want to add support for another language <lang>, here is a guide.

  1. Create a file, treesitter-context-<lang>.el. All of the following is in this file.
  2. Add `treesitter-context--<lang>-node-types`, this is the node types you are interested.
  3. Add `treesitter-context--<lang>-query`, the query patterns used to query nodes. See more information from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Pattern-Matching.html][Emacs Manual]].
  4. Implement `treesitter-context-collect-contexts`, current mojar mode specific method to collect context
  5. (Optional) Implement `treesitter-context-indent-context`. At the moment, this function is used to indent *else* , make sure the *else* has the same indentation with the previous *if*.
  6. `(add-to-list 'treesitter-context--supported-mode '<lang>-ts-mode t)`, so treesitter-context knows that this language is supported.
